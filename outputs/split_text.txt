My dad pretended to
be homeless to spy
on me. I found
out in the worst
way. I 19F moved
out recently and started
college in another state.
My dad was extremely
overprotective growing up, but
I thought I finally
had some space. Turns
out, he followed me.
Not just like tracking
my phone—he literally posed
as a homeless man
near my campus, sitting
outside my dorm almost
daily. I never looked
too closely, but one
day I offered the
man a sandwich. He
looked up, and my
stomach dropped. It was
my dad, wearing old
clothes and a fake
beard. He said he
was "just making sure
I was safe." I
completely lost it. I
reported it to campus
security, and they actually
had footage of him
lurking around. My mom
divorced him after finding
out (she didn’t know
either), and now he’s
blaming me for "breaking
the family." So yeah,
turns out freedom is...
conditional.
